  "question": "Please provide a detailed answer to the following question:\n\nWhat publicly available datasets are typically used for evaluating type inference systems in python?",
  "answer": "Here are some of the **publicly available datasets and benchmarks** that researchers commonly use to evaluate Python type inference systems. These are particularly valuable for static or ML-based inference tools (e.g. Type4Py, HiTyper), dynamic type-checking tools (like Pyre, Pytype), or newer benchmarks focused around large language models (LLMs) or micro-benchmarks. I\u2019ll describe each, highlight key features, and note trade-offs and gaps.\n\n---\n\n## Key Datasets & Benchmarks\n\n### ManyTypes4Py (MT4Py)\n\n- **What it is**: A large-scale Python dataset specifically built for ML-based type inference. It comprises thousands of GitHub projects annotated with type hints. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04706?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Details**:\n  - Over **5,382** Python projects, with more than **869,000** type annotations. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2104.04706?utm_source=openai))  \n  - The dataset has both **clean** and **complete** versions:\n    - *Clean version*: only projects fully type\u2010checked with **mypy**; ~5.1K repos, ~1.2M annotations. ([github.com](https://github.com/saltudelft/many-types-4-py-dataset?utm_source=openai))  \n    - *Complete version*: includes more annotations (even partial), totaling ~3.3M annotations. ([github.com](https://github.com/saltudelft/many-types-4-py-dataset?utm_source=openai))  \n  - The repository has been processed to remove duplicated source files to reduce bias, split into train/validation/test by files, and converted into JSON with AST/hint info using a pipeline (LibSA4Py) ([github.com](https://github.com/saltudelft/many-types-4-py-dataset?utm_source=openai)).  \n- **Use cases / Tools**: Many ML type inference systems rely on MT4Py. For example, Type4Py is built on MT4Py. ([github.com](https://github.com/saltudelft/type4py?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Strengths**:\n  - Large scale (both in number of projects and annotations).\n  - Explicit splitting and deduplication help generalization evaluation.\n  - Supports different annotation completeness levels.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - It reflects only what projects have annotated (potential bias toward well-typed code).\n  - Clean version depends on mypy; tools stricter or looser than mypy may behave differently.\n  - Previously type definitions may miss context of runtime behavior/user-defined types.\n\n---\n\n### TypyBench (2025)\n\n- **What it is**: A recent benchmark focused on evaluating **LLMs** inferring types across entire untyped Python repositories. ([proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/dong25l.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Details**:\n  - It includes **50 high-quality open-source Python repositories**, chosen for diversity and real-world complexity. ([proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/dong25l.html?utm_source=openai))  \n  - All original type annotations are stripped; tools are evaluated on recovering types via LLM output (which can then be type stub files), and evaluated on:\n    - **TypeSim**: semantic similarity between inferred vs ground truth types (allows partial credit).  \n    - **TypeCheck**: number of errors when checking predicted stubs with a real static type checker (global consistency). ([proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/dong25l.html?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Strengths**:\n  - More realistic scenario: whole repositories, untyped code, diversity of type complexity.\n  - Novel metrics that penalize inconsistencies across modules, not just local exact match.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Small number of repos (50), so lower statistical power or overfitting risk.\n  - Focused on LLM behavior; may not align with static tool use-cases exactly.\n\n---\n\n### TypeEvalPy\n\n- **What it is**: A **micro-benchmarking framework** containing small code snippets aimed at targeting specific Python features. Useful for comparing static inference methods. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16882?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Details**:\n  - 154 code snippets with **845 type annotations**, covering **18 categories** (e.g. function returns, arguments, generics, built-ins, etc.) ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16882?utm_source=openai)).  \n  - Provides a standardized metric suite, normalized formats, etc. Allows multiple tools to be evaluated in a containerized, reproducible way. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2312.16882?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Strengths**:\n  - Precisely tests specific, often tricky features (e.g. generics, user-defined types).\n  - Addresses deep corner cases which large datasets may under-represent.\n  - Good for ablation studies, tool component evaluation.\n- **Limitations**:\n  - Very small-scale; may not reflect code complexity or practical deployment.\n  - Does not include global repository context; no evaluation of consistency across modules.\n\n---\n\n### HiTyper uses ManyTypes4Py\n\n- **Details**:\n  - HiTyper is another system (static + ML components) whose evaluation is built on the ManyTypes4Py dataset. ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/hityper/?utm_source=openai))  \n  - HiTyper\u2019s reported metrics (exact match, generic types, user-defined types, return values, etc.) are measured using MT4Py\u2019s \u201ctest\u201d subsets. ([pypi.org](https://pypi.org/project/hityper/?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Significance**: Shows how systems both static/inference and ML methods benchmark on the same standardized large dataset.\n\n---\n\n## Other Benchmarks / Tools to Know\n\nWhile the following are not full annotated datasets *specifically* for type inference, they are used in related contexts (e.g. code understanding, code annotation, auto-completion, type stub generation):\n\n- **Pytype / Pyre / Mypy internal test suites**, many tools use their internal test cases (toy and real library code), but often not fully public or not sufficiently large/standardized for cross-comparison.\n- Datasets drawn from **Typeshed** (which provides types for standard library and many popular third-party libs) are sometimes used to check coverage or consistency but not always as a benchmark for inference tools.\n- Benchmarks for code generation (e.g. DS-1000) are more about generating code; they may include type annotations but not in a way optimized for type inference evaluation. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.11501?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Summary: Comparison Table\n\nHere\u2019s a quick summary to help choose what\u2019s suitable depending on your evaluation goals:\n\n| Dataset / Benchmark | Scale | Context | Strengths | Use When You Need \u2026 |\n|---|---|---|---|---|\n| **ManyTypes4Py** | Large (5,000+ projects) | Annotated real code | Broad coverage of annotations, train/val/test splits, ML focus | Training ML models; broad evaluation across projects |\n| **TypyBench** | Medium (50 repos) | Stripped full repositories | Repository-level evaluation, global consistency metrics | Evaluating LLMs or tools in realistic codebases |\n| **TypeEvalPy** | Small (154 snippets) | Isolated features / corner cases | Precise, controlled, focused on tricky language features | Fine-grained tool comparison; feature-specific evaluation |\n| **HiTyper on MT4Py** | Uses same as ManyTypes4Py | Static + ML combined | Demonstrated performance on generics, user-defined types | Benchmarks mixing static/ML inference, or comparing against MT4Py baselines |\n\n---\n\n## Gaps & Open Challenges\n\nSome of the limitations across existing datasets and benchmarks include:\n\n- **Under-representation of untyped or poorly typed code**: Many projects are already well typed (especially in clean sets), whereas real world legacy code often lacks types or has inconsistencies.\n- **Lack of runtime type behavior**: Static annotations may not reflect types that occur during execution, especially with dynamic features (metaprogramming, monkey patching, dynamic imports).\n- **Limited diversity in type complexity**: Deeply nested generics, union types, user-defined types across module boundaries are often rarer.\n- **Global consistency and cross-module context**: Many datasets focus on local correctness (function return types, parameter types), but consistency across modules (imports, shared types) is less covered.\n- **Versioning and ecosystem evolution**: Tools/new language features (like TypedDict, Protocols) evolve; datasets need updating to reflect new typing PEPs.\n\n---\n\n## Practical Recommendations\n\nIf you\u2019re evaluating or building a type inference system, here are tips on choosing or combining these datasets:\n\n1. **Use ManyTypes4Py** for large scale training, baseline performance, generic coverage. It\u2019s the most widely used large dataset.\n\n2. **Supplement with TypeEvalPy** to stress test specific features your system aims to improve (e.g. generics, user-defined types).\n\n3. **Use TypyBench** to observe real-world behavior at repository level, especially if you care about global consistency or the performance of your system in realistic settings (especially for LLM-based approaches).\n\n4. **Ensure de-duplication** and train/val/test splitting to avoid overfitting to popular patterns. Tools like CD4Py are used in ManyTypes4Py for this. ([github.com](https://github.com/saltudelft/many-types-4-py-dataset?utm_source=openai))\n\n5. **Define clear metrics**: exact match, partial match, top-k accuracy, type consistency over modules. Benchmarks like TypyBench introduce metrics like *TypeSim* and *TypeCheck* that are useful beyond simple matching. ([proceedings.mlr.press](https://proceedings.mlr.press/v267/dong25l.html?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can also list some **GitHub-hosted datasets** (possibly smaller or more recently released) or help find datasets specific to certain kinds of Python code (e.g. web frameworks, data science) to evaluate type inference in that domain. Do you want me to pull those in?",
