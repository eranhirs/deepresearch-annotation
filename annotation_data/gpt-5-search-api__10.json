  "question": "Please provide a detailed answer to the following question:\n\nHow have open-source publishing platforms impacted the global distribution of academic publishing?",
  "answer": "Open-source publishing platforms have profoundly reshaped global academic publishing over the past two decades. Their impacts span technical infrastructure, economic models, equity of access, research practices, and institutional power dynamics. Below is a detailed look at how they\u2019ve influenced distribution globally, citing recent studies and reports to highlight key trends, benefits, and challenges.\n\n---\n\n## What counts as \u201copen-source publishing platforms\u201d\n\nOpen\u2010source publishing platforms typically refer to digital systems and software suites that facilitate peer review, editing, publication, hosting, and archiving of academic content, whose source code is openly shared. Examples include:\n\n- Open Journal Systems (OJS)\n- DSpace\n- Pressbooks\n- Janeway, PubPub, Manifold, Scalar, etc. ([librarypublishing.org](https://librarypublishing.org/excerpt-from-the-2024-directory/?utm_source=openai))\n\nThese platforms often underpin \u201cdiamond\u201d or \u201cplatinum\u201d open access journals\u2014those that charge neither readers nor authors\u2014and are heavily used in institutional repositories, and open science initiatives. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Technical impacts: infrastructure and capacity\n\n1. **Lowered technical and cost barriers**  \n   Open\u2010source platforms reduce the costs associated with journal production and distribution. Since they eliminate licensing fees for publishing software, institutions in resource\u2010constrained regions can set up journals, host repositories, and maintain control over their content. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12326?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Diversification of platforms and tools**  \n   Library publishing surveys show that open\u2010source platforms are increasingly dominant. A 2024 survey found that nearly 50% of library publishers use OJS, while adoption of proprietary platforms has decreased. Platforms like Pressbooks, Janeway, and PubPub have grown. ([librarypublishing.org](https://librarypublishing.org/excerpt-from-the-2024-directory/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Facilitating preprints and non\u2010traditional outputs**  \n   Platforms supporting preprint repositories and self\u2010archiving allow researchers worldwide to share work quickly without going through paywalled journals. Studies indicate researchers in the Global South increasingly use preprints to gain visibility and assess publication practices. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04186?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Economic models and global distribution\n\n1. **Rise of \u201cdiamond\u201d open access**  \n   Diamond/Platinum OA journals\u2014including many supported by open\u2010source infrastructure\u2014enable free access for authors and readers. In Latin America, platforms like SciELO and Redalyc make up almost all OA journals, many operating under diamond models. Globally, between 17,000\u201329,000 journals are diamond OA, representing 73% of OA journals by count but fewer articles. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Growth of APC spending\u2014imbalance and inequity**  \n   Despite open\u2010source platforms enabling diamond OA, many authors still publish under \u201cgold\u201d OA (authors pay APCs) or hybrid models (subscription journals offer OA for a fee). One large study estimated that from 2019 to 2023, over USD 8.3 billion was paid globally in APCs to six major publishers\u2014showing a tripling from 2019 to 2023. This places financial burden disproportionately on well\u2010funded institutions in high\u2010income countries. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16551?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Transformative agreements and institutional contracts**  \n   In response, many institutions have entered into transformative agreements, bundling subscription access with OA publishing rights. These help researchers at participating institutions avoid APCs\u2014but they tend to favor wealthy universities. Smaller or less wealthy institutions, especially in developing regions, often can\u2019t afford to participate, which limits equitable access. ([publishingstate.com](https://publishingstate.com/how-open-is-open-access/2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Equity, access, and global distribution\n\n1. **Closing the access gap for readers**  \n   Open\u2010source platforms paired with OA models remove paywalls, enabling researchers, practitioners, and the public worldwide to access literature. This is especially critical in low\u2010 and middle\u2010income countries, where subscription costs are prohibitive. ([thenmc.org](https://thenmc.org/the-impact-of-open-access-publishing-on-research-dissemination/?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Enabling authors in Global South**  \n   Platforms that support diamond OA, preprint servers, and institutional repositories allow researchers from underfunded institutions to publish without APCs. Studies indicate willingness and growing usage of preprints among scholars in the Global South. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2308.04186?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Language, regional content, and local initiatives**  \n   Many open\u2010source, noncommercial platforms support publishing in local languages and prioritize regional research issues. For instance, Latin American journals using open\u2010source infrastructure serve Spanish- and Portuguese-language scholarship, which often underrepresented in commercial Western journals. This increases diversity of content accessible globally. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Research practices and scholarly norms\n\n1. **Enhancing transparency and post\u2010publication evaluation**  \n   Proposals like community\u2010driven publishing systems (e.g. in arXiv), with open peer review and communal evaluation, are supported by open\u2010source infrastructure. These evolve norms toward more transparency and long\u2010term evaluation beyond initial publication. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12326?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Impact on discovery, visibility, and citation**  \n   Open content is more discoverable. Open access articles are cited earlier and more frequently, especially when freely accessible via open\u2010source platforms. Increased downloads, sharing, and reuse also result. ([thenmc.org](https://thenmc.org/the-impact-of-open-access-publishing-on-research-dissemination/?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Role in rapid knowledge mobilization**  \n   Platforms enabling preprint sharing or fast OA publication have proven critical during emergencies (e.g. pandemics). Though that example area is beyond the period some studies cover, the groundwork is laid by open\u2010source infrastructure that supports quick dissemination. The global research community benefits. (While not always directly assessed in the sources today, this trend is widely acknowledged in OA literature, e.g. open dissemination in biomedical research.) ([blog.routledge.com](https://blog.routledge.com/open-access/why-open-access-matters/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Challenges and limitations\n\n1. **Funding and sustainability**  \n   Open-source platforms reduce software licensing costs, but other costs remain: peer review management, editorial support, hosting, archiving, and infrastructure maintenance. Diamond OA journals often rely on institutional subsidies, volunteer labor, or government support\u2014none guaranteed. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access?utm_source=openai))\n\n2. **Visibility and indexing issues**  \n   Many open-source, regional, or diamond OA journals are under-represented in major citation databases (Web of Science, Scopus), which affects prestige and author incentives. Researchers seeking tenure or funding may avoid such journals because they\u2019re not \u201crecognized.\u201d ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamond_open_access?utm_source=openai))\n\n3. **Quality control and predatory risks**  \n   As OA expands, so do concerns about predatory journals that charge APCs without rigorous peer review or editorial oversight. Open infrastructure by itself can't guarantee quality. Hybrid and transformed journals sometimes are perceived as compromising rigor under pressure of volume. ([theguardian.com](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2025/jul/13/quality-of-scientific-papers-questioned-as-academics-overwhelmed-by-the-millions-published?utm_source=openai))\n\n4. **Uneven uptake of transformative agreements**  \n   These institutional contracts tend to benefit those already well resourced. Institutions in the Global South may be excluded due to cost, reducing gains in equitable distribution. ([publishingstate.com](https://publishingstate.com/how-open-is-open-access/2025/?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## Recent trends and future directions\n\n- **Rapid growth in APC spending:** The global cost borne by researchers or institutions for gold/hybrid OA has nearly tripled in a few years. This suggests OA is scaling\u2014but also accumulating economic tension. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2407.16551?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Policy pushes from funders and governments:** Initiatives like Plan S (requiring open access for publicly funded research), UNESCO\u2019s recommendations, and national policies are influencing more OA and supporting diamond OA models. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plan_S?utm_source=openai))  \n- **Platform innovation continues:** More open-source tools appear, enabling cooperative publishing, enhanced data and multimedia formats, distributed peer review, and community engagement. ([librarypublishing.org](https://librarypublishing.org/excerpt-from-the-2024-directory/?utm_source=openai))  \n\n---\n\n## Overall assessment\n\nWhile open\u2010source publishing platforms have not solved every problem in academic publishing, they have significantly reshaped the global distribution of knowledge:\n\n- They enlarge access for readers globally by breaking down paywalls.\n- They give authors in underrepresented regions tools and outlets to publish and share without prohibitive fees.\n- They expand the variety of formats and voices in scholarship, especially local/regional languages and topics.\n- They pressure commercial publishers and subscription models toward greater openness and accountability.\n\nAt the same time, economic inequalities persist, quality assurance varies, and the prestige system in academia still values traditional journals heavily. Sustainability of open infrastructure and equitable participation must be continually supported if open\u2010source platforms are to fulfill their promise.\n\n---\n\nIf you want, I can give case studies from specific regions (e.g. Latin America, Africa, Asia) or specific disciplines to illustrate these impacts in more detail.
