  "question": "Please provide a detailed answer to the following question:\n\nWhat is the known evidence for pervasiveness of gaming of citation metrics like citation count and h-index?",
  "answer": "Here\u2019s a detailed review of the evidence showing that gaming\u2014manipulation or distortion\u2014is pervasive in citation-based metrics like citation counts and the h-index. The evidence comes from recent studies, documented cases, systematic analyses, and investigations into institutional practices.  \n\n---\n\n## 1. Types of Citation Metric Gaming\n\nBefore looking at evidence, it\u2019s helpful to clarify common tactics:\n\n- **Self-citation**: Citing one's own past work to inflate counts.  \n- **Citation cartels or collusion**: Groups of authors or journals mutually citing each other.  \n- **Coercive citation**: Editors forcing authors to add citations to boost journal metrics.  \n- **Merging or splitting publications**: Manipulating Google Scholar or other databases by merging multiple works under one author or splitting a work to appear more times.  \n- **Citation purchasing and planted citations**: Paying services to include citations (even fake ones) to raise metrics.  \n- **Metadata manipulation**: \u201cSneaking\u201d citations into metadata so they count in metrics despite not appearing in the published work.  \n\n---\n\n## 2. Empirical Studies and Systematic Analyses\n\n### a. Studies detecting orchestration and collusion\n\n- The paper *\u201cMetrics to Detect Small-Scale and Large-Scale Citation Orchestration\u201d* (2024) analyzes citation behavior using Scopus. It develops indicators of \u201corchestration,\u201d i.e. citation networks used strategically to enhance one\u2019s h-index. It finds that many authors show extreme patterns in citation behavior (such as relying heavily on small groups of citing authors or excessive co-authorship) indicative of gaming. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19219?utm_source=openai))\n\n- In *\u201cGaming the Metrics? Bibliometric Anomalies and the Integrity Crisis in Global University Rankings\u201d* (2025), Lokman I. Meho examines 1,000 high-output institutions and finds 98 with rapid increases in publications (2018-19 to 2023-24) suggestive of metric-driven behavior. Among these, many had declines in first/corresponding authorship, increases in internal citation/collaboration clusters, publishing in delisted journals, and high retraction rates. These are strong institutional signals of gaming. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448?utm_source=openai))\n\n### b. Experimental or quasi-experimental exposures\n\n- **Citation purchasing experiment**: In *\u201cCitation manipulation through citation mills and pre-print servers\u201d* (2025) researchers reviewed ~1.6 million Google Scholar profiles. They directly tested a \u201ccitation boosting\u201d service by creating a fictional author and buying 50 citations, showing that such services can successfully inflate metrics. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Metadata \u201csneaked references\u201d**: The study *\u201cSneaked references: Cooked reference metadata inflate citation counts\u201d* (2023) reports that about 9% of references in the metadata of certain journals did not appear in the actual article text but still contributed to citation counts. Conversely, 56% of references that were in the article text were not captured in metadata, further showing discrepancies and possibilities for manipulation. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02192?utm_source=openai))\n\n### c. Analyses of author-level manipulation\n\n- Research shows that certain traits are statistically associated with potential manipulation. For example, a low ratio of total citations to h-index squared tends to indicate that citations are being strategically targeted to boost h (since raising h requires a certain number of papers with h citations). Such low ratios are unusual and may signal gaming. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11739-023-03447-w?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Analyses of Google Scholar profiles (versus more selective indices like Scopus or Web of Science) show that some authors have extremely inflated citation counts in GS which drop dramatically in \u201ccleaner\u201d databases. This suggests that Google Scholar\u2019s looser indexing criteria are often exploited. ([mdpi.com](https://www.mdpi.com/2073-431X/13/11/287?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## 3. Documented Cases and Anecdotes\n\n- **\u201cIke Antkare\u201d**: A famous hoax created on purpose to expose absurdity of metrics\u2014this fictional researcher was assigned many publications and a high h-index, all without existing. It demonstrates how numbers alone can be manipulated. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12109-025-10042-8?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Erroneous Google Scholar attributions**: A recent (December 2025) Times Higher Education article reported that thousands of mistaken citations in Google Scholar profiles are skewing h-index leaderboards. Common surnames and automatic author assignment lead to inflation. ([timeshighereducation.com](https://www.timeshighereducation.com/news/google-scholars-citation-errors-skew-h-index-leaderboards?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Authorship abuses**: Several studies and reports document gift, guest, sold, or ghost authorship, hyper-authorship (papers with very large number of authors), which inflate publication counts and associated citation metrics. These are often part of a system of gaming. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## 4. Institutional and Rank-Level Evidence\n\n- The \u201cResearch Integrity Risk Index\u201d (RI\u00b2), introduced in 2025 by Lokman Meho, uses indicators such as retraction rates, self-citation, and publications in journals delisted from major databases\u2014behaviors often correlated with gaming. It documents risks at the institutional level, showing that many universities have elevated risk signals. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Research_Integrity_Risk_Index?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Universities in India, Lebanon, Saudi Arabia, UAE showed publication surges (up to ~965\u2009%) in a few years, accompanied by declines in first/corresponding authorship, many publications in questionable venues, and clustering of citations internally\u2014consistent with institutions gaming for rankings rather than scientific merit. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## 5. Metrics Susceptibility to Gaming\n\n- The h-index has intrinsic features that make it vulnerable. For example, only papers near the threshold for h need to be cited enough to raise h\u2014the lower-cited tail may be irrelevant. So selective self-citation (mostly of just enough papers) or merging/splitting works can increase h efficiently with small effort. ([link.springer.com](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11739-023-03447-w?utm_source=openai))\n\n- In the broader \u201cAuthor-level metrics\u201d literature, it's commonly noted that h-index and total citations correlate strongly with self-citation, coercive citation, and even computer-generated documents (SCIgen) when using Google Scholar-type platforms. ([en.wikipedia.org](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Author-level_metrics?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## 6. Why the problem is pervasive\n\nKey reasons and evidence:\n\n- **Incentive structures**: Funding, hiring, promotion, and institutional rankings often reward high citation counts and h-indices. When these metrics are tied to rewards (jobs, promotion, funding), they become targets to optimize. [Goodhart\u2019s law in action.] ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Looser verification and indexing**: Databases like Google Scholar index non-peer-reviewed material, pre-prints, user-uploaded content, etc. These are harder to verify and easier to manipulate. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Global spread**: Though many high-visibility cases have been in North America/Europe, studies show gaming in many parts of the world (e.g., Asia and the Middle East). Institutional surges in publication and citation metrics in countries like India, Saudi Arabia, UAE reflect metric-driven publication systems. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.06448?utm_source=openai))\n\n- **Technological enablement**: The availability of \u201ccitation boosting\u201d services, AI-generated documents, pre-print servers, and metadata manipulation tools make these strategies more scalable and less risky. ([nature.com](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-025-88709-7?utm_source=openai))\n\n---\n\n## 7. Limitations and Open Questions\n\nWhile the evidence is strong, there are nuances and limitations:\n\n- Distinguishing between legitimate citations (self-citations, field norm collaborations) vs manipulative behavior is not always easy. Studies use thresholds and statistical anomalies to flag potential gaming, but cannot prove intent. ([arxiv.org](https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.19219?utm_source=openai))\n\n- Widespread data access is limited; many databases are proprietary (Scopus, Web of Science), and Google Scholar data is not transparent, making full assessment difficult.  \n\n- Some exemptions: lower-output fields or early career researchers have different norms; what looks like \u201cgaming\u201d may sometimes reflect collaboration or interdisciplinarity.  \n\n---\n\n## 8. Summary\n\nIn short:\n\n- There is **substantial evidence** that gaming of citation counts and h-index is widespread.  \n- Empirical studies using large bibliometric datasets show patterns consistent with manipulation: citation rings, extreme self-citation behavior, institutional surges tied to rankings, retraction risk.  \n- Direct experiments (buying citations, creating fictitious scholars) prove many of the methods work and are being utilized.  \n- Key platforms (Google Scholar particularly) show vulnerabilities due to automated and unverified indexing.  \n- Institutional incentives amplify the issue, encouraging behavior that prioritizes numbers over substance.  \n\n---\n\nIf you like, I can share a list of major papers documenting metric gaming, or quantitatively map which fields or regions have the most documented evidence.
